I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group, led by prof. Emanuele Rodolà.

My research interest at the moment focus on Artificial Intelligence for Music. The aspect I like most about research is seeing the generalization and ordering power of math in action, thus its ability to unify seemingly different things and to separate different causes and consequences.
