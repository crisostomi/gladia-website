I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group, led by prof. Emanuele Rodol√†.

My research interests at the moment focus on artificial intelligence for music, and vector quantile regression, a statistical inference method based on optimal transport.
