Hi! I'm Hazem, a PhD student of the National PhD in Artificial Intelligence. The idea of machines mimicking human creativity and behavior has always fascinated me. Although they are becoming more capable with every day that passes, there is a lot of areas that still have to be explored to unlock their true potential.

Until now, my main research point has been model alignment. By understanding how to stitch, merge and align them, we can avoid using many resources (time, computational power, space and so on) leading to more efficient and accessible AI development

When I am not doing research, I love relaxing by doing sports, gaming and capturing moments with my camera.
