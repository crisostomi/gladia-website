I am a second-year PhD Student in Natural Language Processing at the Sapienza University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group, led by prof. Emanuele Rodolà. I spend a lot of time studying Natural Language Processing technologies. In particular, my research fields are Multilinguality, Machine Translation and Geometric Deep Learning.
