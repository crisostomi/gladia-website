Hello! üëã I'm Adrian, currently a PhD student of the Computer Science department at Sapienza University, dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of **Large Language Models** (LLMs). My focus revolves around probing the **robustness**, **interpretability** and diverse **applications** of these models, particularly intrigued by how they adeptly handle various tasks.

My academic journey began in Software Engineering, where my passion for code took root and blossomed. As I ventured into graduate studies, I found my true calling in the captivating field of Artificial Intelligence. The complexity and challenges inherent in AI have become my intellectual playground, offering a continuous source of fascination.

Stepping away from the academic rigors, I find solace in the world of rogue-like and souls-like video games. üéÆ Mastering the intricacies of game mechanics is not just a hobby; it's a way to challenge myself and exercise a different facet of my cognitive abilities.

In the midst of pixels and quests, I see parallels to the challenges I grapple with in the realm of Artificial Intelligence. Navigating both virtual and academic landscapes keeps my mind agile and ready for the next level of innovation and discovery. üöÄüïπÔ∏è
