Hi! Iâ€™m Mario Prignano, an undergrad student in Math and AI at Sapienza University of Rome. Iâ€™ve always loved both music and AI. I remember I started coding in middle school, by trying to generate symbolic music with a very simple script, so I ended up studying generative modelsâ€”especially the ones that write text or make music.

I hope i'll learn as much as I can to advance this subject, and I hope this subject can learn as much as it can from me ðŸ™‚
