This is Mario Iacobelli, Data Scientist in training. My educational path began with classical high school, but later I decided to take a different path and I moved to Rome to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Automation Engineering. During those years, I discovered the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, which immediately caught my interest and pushed me to specialize with a Master’s in Data Science. Now I’m almost at the end of my M.Sc. journey, and I’m currently working on my thesis with Professor Emanuele Rodolà and Gladia team on topic of Merging LLMs for enhanced reasoning capabilities, a challenging and exciting area of research.
