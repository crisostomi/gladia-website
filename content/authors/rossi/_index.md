I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the [Gladia](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it) group at **Sapienza University of Rome**, working with [Emanuele Rodolà](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/authors/rodola/). My research explores how **AI can help decode animal communication**, focusing on how multimodal models can reveal what wild animals communicate to one another, what this tells us about their intelligence and consciousness, and how such understanding can reshape our relationship with the natural world.

Before turning my attention to animal communication, I worked at [Vant AI](https://www.vant.ai/), developing **[generative models for structural biology and drug discovery](https://www.vant.ai/neo-1)**, and earned my PhD between **Imperial College London** and **Twitter**, supervised by [Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein) and focusing on **Graph Neural Networks**. Earlier, I was part of **Fabula AI**, a deep learning startup for fake news detection that was [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai). I hold degrees in Computer Science from **Imperial College London** and the **University of Cambridge**.

Outside research, I love scuba diving, hiking, and quiet moments in nature.
