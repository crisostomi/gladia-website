As a Ph.D. student at Sapienza University of Rome, I am part of the GLADIA research group led by Emanuele Rodol\`{a}. With a background in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Verona (2021), I specialize in Geometric Deep Learning, Geometry Processing, and 3D spectral shape analysis. 

My research interest lies in exploring the intersection of geometry processing and graph learning, with a particular emphasis on utilizing spectral techniques in graph analysis. My current research directions encompass:
- Developing spectral representations for graphs and subgraphs to address alignment problems.
-  Analyzing biomolecular interactions from a geometric perspective.
- Investigating the use of spectral structures to represent graphs.

I am proud to have received recognition for my Master's thesis with the Best Italian Master Thesis in Computer Graphics (Matteo Dellepiane award) at the Italian Chapter of EuroGraphics (STAG).
In March, I'm going to join the research group of Alex Bronstein at Technion (Israel) to start a collaboration on spectral analysis applied to dynamic systems.}
