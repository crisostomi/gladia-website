  I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group, led by prof. Emanuele Rodolà.
  I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Verona. My Master’s thesis titled "Data-driven inverse spectral geometry: learning to generate shapes from multi spectra" has received the Matteo Dellepiane Award for best thesis in Computer Graphics for the year 2021.
  My research activity is focused on spectral geometry processing and geometric deep learning.
