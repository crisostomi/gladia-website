Hey! I’m Giorgos, currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at EPFL. My research lies at the intersection of theory and practice, where I explore how principled approaches can inform and improve current, as well as inspire new methods in deep learning.

Before EPFL, I studied Computer Science at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, graduating top of my class. My thesis focused on higher-order deep unfolding networks for compressed sensing, achieving state-of-the-art performance at ultra-low sampling rates.

Outside the lab, I spend my time swimming, cooking and sleeping. The rest of the time is spent on research, which revolves around the structure of representations and the properties we expect them to have in different contexts, and on machine unlearning.
