Hi! I'm a second-year Data Science Master's student at Sapienza. I wasn't exposed to machine learning until grad school - during my Bachelor's, I studied Electrical Engineering. Recently, I joined the GLADIA Lab to do some research. I've been focusing on model steering and adversarial attacks on large language models.

I'm at a pivotal point in my career, trying to decide whether I should pursue a PhD to do meaningful research, become an expert in a niche, and contribute something valuable to the world, or just embrace life as a corporate slave. Or maybe both. We'll see.
