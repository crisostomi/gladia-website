Hello, I'm Luca, an undergraduate student in Mathematical Sciences for Artificial Intelligence at Sapienza University of Rome. My passion for music began when I picked up the piano as a child. After several years of classical training, I moved behind the DJ boothâ€”spinning tracks and working for some time as a DJ. Today, I fuse those hands-on audio roots with deep learning, focusing on audio codecs, signal processing, and music representations, all while deliberately experimenting with creative pipelines.
