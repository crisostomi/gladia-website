I'm an incoming PhD student interested in modular deep learning, model merging, time series analysis, and LLMs. Iâ€™m passionate about building flexible and generalizable AI systems that can be assembled in a data-free manner, so that large models can become highly adaptable, scalable, and fun to play with like Lego blocks.

Outside of academics, I enjoy practicing competitive sports and photography.
