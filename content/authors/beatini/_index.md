{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at Sapienza University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group led by Prof. Emanuele Rodolà. I also work as an AI Research Engineer in industry, focusing on applied research and large-scale AI systems.

My interests revolve around large language models and reasoning in all its forms. I am currently in my “random walk” phase, exploring different directions in AI and staying open to new ideas and approaches.

An engineer at heart, I am particularly excited by research that can have a tangible real-world impact.

I hold a B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering from the University of Pisa and an M.Sc. joint degree in Bionics Engineering from the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies and the University of Pisa.
