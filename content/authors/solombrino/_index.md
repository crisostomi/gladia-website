{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a PhD student at GLADIA Research Group, under the supervision of Prof. Emanuele Rodol√† (Sapienza University of Rome).

My current research centers on model merging, and I'm also planning to dive into audio generation and music editing.

During my BSc in Computer Science, I got really interested in High-performance computing and GPU programming, which pushed me to pursue an MSc focused on deep learning. In my master's, I worked on applying AI to music, medical images, and natural language, while also exploring techniques like transfer learning, heterogeneous knowledge distillation, and disentangled representation learning.

I am fan of minimalism, growth, mindfulness, and EDM music.
