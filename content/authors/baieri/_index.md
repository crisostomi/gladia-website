{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a Ph.D. student at Sapienza with the GLADIA research group since 2021. I earned my MSc degree in Computer Science with my thesis "Metric Regularization of Implicit Geometric Models". 
My research focuses on AI-enabled applications for Computer Graphics; in particular, I am currently working on various directions for application of neural implicit geometric representations.
I dedicate most of my free time to sports, music and gaming.
