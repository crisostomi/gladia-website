I am a Post Doctoral researcher, awarded with a Humboldt Post-Doctoral Fellowship, at the University of Tuebingen in the Real-Virtual Humans group led by Prof. Gerard Pons-Moll.

Previously, I was a post-doc at Sapienza University of Rome in the GLADIA group led by Prof. Emanuele Rodolà, leading a work package of SPECGEO ERC project. I followed the University of Verona’s Ph.D program in Computer Science, under the supervision of Umberto Castellani, collecting a Best PhD Thesis award by EG-Italy. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Verona (2017).

I work on Spectral Shape Analysis, Shape Matching Geometric Deep Learning, and Virtual Humans. My work appears in top level conferences and journals (NeurIPS, IJCV, CGF, 3DV), obtaining also a Best Student Paper Award (3DV 2020). I served as conference organizer (RCD Committee at Siggraph, Volunteer Chair at 3DV 2018 and STAG 2021), as reviewer for several journals and conferences (e.g., PAMI, TCVG, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR), obtaining five Outstanding Reviewer Awards.

I am involved in many fruitful collaborations ('Ecole polytechnique (LIX), Max-Planck Institute (MPI), INRIA Strasbourg, Sapienza University of Rome, University College London (UCL), University of Milan, University of Verona), and in projects financed by Google and ERC.
