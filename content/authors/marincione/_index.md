Hello there!
I am Davide Marincione, Computer Scientist by trade, and "how did I end up doing this"-er by the forces of the universe.
My obsession with computers can be traced back a long way, ever since middle school I started making crappy videogames, programming my TI-83, and doing all sorts of other tomfoolery. Sometime around high school I decided that I would get into Sapienza's Computer Science course and, well... Now I have almost finished my M.Sc. here.
As it were, over the uni. years I got more and more into machine learning (for which I like to think I've got a bit of a knack), and the cool folks here in the lab decided to take me on board ;P.
