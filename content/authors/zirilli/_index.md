Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Alessandro, a research intern at Gladia and an MSc student at Sapienza University of Rome, working on model merging!

I started out as a mathematician, drawn to the beauty of the discipline and its formalism. While I appreciated its intricate structure and the potential of its applications, during my thesis I realised I was more excited by real-world impact. Thatâ€™s what led me to enrol in a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, which Iâ€™m currently pursuing. Along the way, I got into deep learning, which finally showed me the impact science can have on the world, and I had the opportunity to join this amazing group! ðŸš€
