{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am an enthusiastic Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group, led by prof. Emanuele Rodolà.

I believe curiosity to have a primary role in guiding research, and hence I am always looking forward to explore new directions in my field. My background includes hands-on research experience in Natural Language Understanding, Computer Vision and Geometric Deep Learning. Some of my more stable interests include frontier Machine Learning themes such as Graph Representation Learning, Few-Shot Learning and Causality.

I wholeheartedly advocate for cleaner code in ML, as complexity should not be fought with more complexity. Maybe unsurprisingly at this point, I really enjoy coding. Funnily enough, I enjoy it so much that I often code as a mean to get away from a tiring day of coding.

In my (too little) free time, I enjoy throwing away my laptop to reconnect with nature through hiking and/or camping. Finally, like most of the humans on this planet, I enjoy travelling and good food.
