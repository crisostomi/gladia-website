{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Sapienza, currently working under the supervision of Prof. Emanuele Rodolà.

My interests lie in generative models, in particular autoregressive and diffusion based, audio/music synthesis, and computer graphics (especially as an enthusiast of animation movies and video games).

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies/series, drinking beers with friends, and playing board games (the last two are often not mutually exclusive).
