{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a PhD student at Sapienza in the Computer Science department, under supervision of professor Emanuele Rodol√†.

My interests lie in generative models, in particular autoregressive and diffusion models, audio and music synthesis and computer graphics (especially as an animation movies and videgames enthusiast).

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies/series, drinking beers with friends, and playing board-games (the last two are often not mutually esclusive).
