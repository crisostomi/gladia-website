{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a Ph.D. student at Sapienza - University of Rome and I am part of the GLADIA research
group, under the supervision of professor Emanuele Rodol√†.

I am a Computer Graphics enthusiast, and this makes me love to explore any related field, from
Geometry Processing to Procedural Shading.
I strongly believe that knowledge is not modular and made of compartments, but instead
that there exist many connections, not only between fields of the same area, but also between
completely different disciplines. I put a lot of effort in finding these correlations and trying to
make my works the most interdisciplinary as possible.
For the same reason, I also like to span in other research areas in Computer Science. Other
fields that fascinate me are Linear Algebra, Numerical Simulations and GPU Algorithms.

I am a staunch supporter of hardcore programming, and I like my code well organized and
strongly optimized. I firmly believe in the open-source paradigm, and I like to contribute
to the vast community whenever I can.
