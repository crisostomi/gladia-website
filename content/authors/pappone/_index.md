{style="text-align: justify;"}
I'm a P.h.D. student at Sapienza, sponsored by PSTP Technoscience, as well as an entrepreneur. 

I have a background in Physics (unibo) and Applied Mathematics (polito & ASP), as well as an MBA at Collège Dés Ingènieurs.
I am fascinated by the phenomenon of learning as we know it in nature and in our own subjective experience. This makes me hopelessly obssesed with leveraging mathematical and geometric properties of neural networks to render them more sample-efficient, fast and robust to perturbations, for I believe this to be the most practical way of understanding cognition itself. 
I am also a staunch supporter of a strong Italian and European AI infrastructure.

I Co-founded Exo Italia, AI Sparks, Checkpoint, Latina Digital Days, Spectral.
