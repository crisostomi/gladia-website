Hey! I’m Tommaso, currently doing a Master’s in Data Science at EPFL. Between lectures and problem sets, I spend my time at GLADIA working on LLMs—mainly model merging and figuring out how to make these systems more interpretable and safer.

My academic path is a bit unconventional: I hold a BSc in AI and Mathematics from Amsterdam and a Philosophy degree from Rome. That means I probably know more math than most philosophers, more computer science than most mathematicians, and more philosophy than most computer scientists. Not entirely sure if that’s a strength or just confusing—but it keeps things interesting.

When I’m not  reading papers or coding, I’m usually listening to music, watching films, or diving into some old philosophy book—though admittedly, not as often as I used to.
