As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Sapienza - University of Rome, I am part of the GLADIA research group under Professor Emanuele Rodol√†. My passion for music drives my academic pursuits as I enjoy playing, listening, and exploring it from various angles. I am particularly interested in applying artificial intelligence to signal processing, and I relish the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and stimulation.

My research focus encompasses deep learning, signal processing, signal separation, autoregressive, and diffusion models.
