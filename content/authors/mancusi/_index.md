As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Sapienza - University of Rome, I am part of the GLADIA research group under Professor Emanuele Rodolà. My passion for music drives my academic pursuits since I enjoy playing, listening, and exploring it from various points of view. I am particularly interested in applying artificial intelligence to signal processing, and I relish the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and stimulation.

I received a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Physics (Quantum Information) at Sapienza, and nowadays, my research focus encompasses deep learning, source separation, and generative models such as autoregressive and diffusion models.
