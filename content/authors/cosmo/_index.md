I have been an Assistant Professor at the University of Venice since 2021, after spending two years as a PostDoc in the GLADIA research group. Previously,  I was PostDoc in the  Geometric Deep Learning group of Prof. Michael Bronstein in Lugano (Switzerland) and, before that, at  Ca' Foscari University of Venice.  I am a member of the Computer Vision spin-off DigitalViews Srl., with which I've been the Scientific Advisor of several industrial projects concerning the in-line quality control from both a metrological and non-metrological (e.g. scratches or visual anomalies) point of view. I'm on the program committee and serve as a referee in several international Journals and Conferences (including IJCV, PR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS). I've organized several tutorials on topics related to shape analysis at several top conferences in Graphics and Computer Vision.
