I am an Industrial Ph.D. student at Sapienza University of Rome, in the GLADIA research group and Translated srl in the AI research group. I'm particularly interested in generative models and Natural Language Processing. I'm working on [Data Tools For Heart](https://www.datatools4heart.eu/), focusing on ways to safely train deep learning models without harming data privacy and, in doing so, enabling the application of deep learning for a wider variety of tasks. In particular I'm currently working on generating private text data with differential privacy and LLMs for medical diagnostics. 

I am really excited about AI and all the fields revolving around it like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Robotics.
