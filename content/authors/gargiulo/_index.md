Hi, I am Antonio Andrea Gargiulo, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science here at Sapienza University of Rome. I ended up here because of my passion for finding out how things work. I also have a passion for physics and mathematics, which I believe are the foundation of computer science! I like reading above all science books, so I recommend a lot of Feynman's books, but now papers take up all my reading time. 

My research focuses on computer vision, model merging, and representation learning, with a particular emphasis on vision models. I am especially interested in developing a theoretical understanding of these techniques and characterizing their potential to improve model performance and enable the sustainable reuse of existing model knowledge. Ultimately, my goal is to leverage these insights to design learning algorithms that are flexible, efficient, and require minimal training, similar to a database of knowledge or skills for AI models. If you're interested in learning more about my work or research, or would like to collaborate in this area, please feel free to contact me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
