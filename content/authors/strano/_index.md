Hi! I am Giorgio. I used to love Lego, and I think that's why I am now a fan of deep learning architectures.
I am thrilled to work on AI techniques that have the potential to reshape the landscape of artistic creation, by giving artists a chance to break into new frontiers of experimentation.

I love logic, problem solving and algorithms. At the moment, I am very passionate about studying latent spaces and neural encodings: 
there is still so much left to discover, and I think we are only getting started on our journey to fully understand the potential of neural architectures.

When you approach research like a treasure hunt, you never know what you might find along the way!
