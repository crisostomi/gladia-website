I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, where I am part of the GLADIA research group, led by prof. Emanuele Rodol√†.

I am fascinated with a broad spectrum of research fields in Computer Science, revolving around Artificial Intelligence and Geometry, and the cross contamination of ideas coming from these topics.

My research activity is focused on **geometry processing**, **geometric deep learning** and **representation learning**.
