I am Antonio Norelli, a Computer Science PhD student at the Sapienza University of Rome working on AI and deep learning in the GLADIA research group, advised by Emanuele Rodolà.

Before joining the group, I studied physics (BSc), computer science (MSc), and pursued the SSAS interdisciplinary honors program. I worked as a remote Research Intern for Spiketrap (San Francisco, CA), and as an Applied Scientist Intern for the Amazon Lablet in Tübingen (Germany).
