abstract: PromptSource is a system for creating, sharing, and using natural
  language prompts. Prompts are functions that map an example from a dataset to
  a natural language input and target output. Using prompts to train and query
  language models is an emerging area in NLP that requires new tools that let
  users develop and refine these prompts collaboratively. PromptSource addresses
  the emergent challenges in this new setting with (1) a templating language for
  defining data-linked prompts, (2) an interface that lets users quickly iterate
  on prompt development by observing outputs of their prompts on many examples,
  and (3) a community-driven set of guidelines for contributing new prompts to a
  common pool. Over 2,000 prompts for roughly 170 datasets are already available
  in PromptSource. PromptSource is available at
