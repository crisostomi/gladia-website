abstract: The question whether one can recover the shape of a geometric object from
  its Laplacian spectrum ('hear the shape of the drum') is a classical problem in
  spectral geometry with a broad range of implications and applications. While theoretically
  the answer to this question is negative (there exist examples of iso-spectral but
  non-isometric manifolds), little is known about the practical possibility of using
  the spectrum for shape reconstruction and optimization. In this paper, we introduce
  a numerical procedure called isospectralization, consisting of deforming one shape
  to make its Laplacian spectrum match that of another. We implement the isospectralization
  procedure using modern differentiable programming techniques and exemplify its applications
  in some of the classical and notoriously hard problems in geometry processing, computer
  vision, and graphics such as shape reconstruction, pose and style transfer, and
  dense deformable correspondence. © 2019 IEEE.
