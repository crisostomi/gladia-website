abstract: CLIP proved that aligning visual and language spaces is key to solving many
  vision tasks without explicit training, but required to train image and text encoders
  from scratch on a huge dataset. LiT improved this by only training the text encoder
  and using a pre-trained vision network. In this paper, we show that a common space
  can be created without any training at all, using single-domain encoders (trained
  with or without supervision) and a much smaller amount of image-text pairs. Furthermore,
  our model has unique properties. Most notably, deploying a new version with updated
  training samples can be done in a matter of seconds. Additionally, the representations
  in the common space are easily interpretable as every dimension corresponds to the
  similarity of the input to a unique entry in the multimodal dataset. Experiments
  on standard zero-shot visual benchmarks demonstrate the typical transfer ability
  of image-text models. Overall, our method represents a simple yet surprisingly strong
  baseline for foundation multi-modal models, raising important questions on their
  data efficiency and on the role of retrieval in machine learning.
