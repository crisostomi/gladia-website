abstract: 'In this paper, we provide a theoretical foundation for pointwise map recovery
  from functional maps and highlight its relation to a range of shape correspondence
  methods based on spectral alignment. With this analysis in hand, we develop a novel
  spectral registration technique: Fast Sinkhorn Filters, which allows for the recovery
  of accurate and bijective pointwise correspondences with a superior time and memory
  complexity in comparison to existing approaches. Our method combines the simple
  and concise representation of correspondence using functional maps with the matrix
  scaling schemes from computational optimal transport. By exploiting the sparse structure
  of the kernel matrices involved in the transport map computation, we provide an
  efficient trade-off between acceptable accuracy and complexity for the problem of
  dense shape correspondence.'
