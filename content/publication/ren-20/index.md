abstract: In this paper we propose an approach for computing multiple high-quality
  near-isometric dense correspondences between a pair of 3D shapes. Our method is
  fully automatic and does not rely on user-provided landmarks or descriptors. This
  allows us to analyze the full space of maps and extract multiple diverse and accurate
  solutions, rather than optimizing for a single optimal correspondence as done in
  most previous approaches. To achieve this, we propose a compact tree structure based
  on the spectral map representation for encoding and enumerating possible rough initializations,
  and a novel efficient approach for refining them to dense pointwise maps. This leads
  to a new method capable of both producing multiple high-quality correspondences
  across shapes and revealing the symmetry structure of a shape without a priori information.
  In addition, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method is robust
  and results in more accurate correspondences than state-of-the-art for shape matching
  and symmetry detection.
