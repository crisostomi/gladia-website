abstract: The Average Mixing Kernel Signature is a novel spectral signature for points
  on non-rigid three-dimensional shapes. It is based on a quantum exploration process
  of the shape surface, where the average transition probabilities between the points
  of the shape are summarised in the finite-time average mixing kernel. A band-filtered
  spectral analysis of this kernel then yields the AMKS. Crucially, we show that opting
  for a finite time-evolution allows the signature to account for a mixing of the
  Laplacian eigenspaces, similar to what is observed in the presence of noise, explaining
  the increased noise robustness of this signature when compared to alternative signatures.
  We perform an extensive experimental analysis of the AMKS under a wide range of
  problem scenarios, evaluating the performance of our descriptor under different
  sources of noise (vertex jitter and topological), shape representations (mesh and
  point clouds), as well as when only a partial view of the shape is available. Our
  experiments show that the AMKS consistently outperforms two of the most widely used
  spectral signatures, the Heat Kernel Signature and the Wave Kernel Signature, and
  suggest that the AMKS should be the signature of choice for various compute vision
  problems, including as input of deep convolutional architectures for shape analysis.
