abstract: Abstract In this paper we develop an in-depth theoretical investigation
  of the discrete Hamiltonian eigenbasis, which remains quite unexplored in the geometry
  processing community. This choice is supported by the fact that Dirichlet eigenfunctions
  can be equivalently computed by defining a Hamiltonian operator, whose potential
  energy and localization region can be controlled with ease. We vary with continuity
  the potential energy and study the relationship between the Dirichlet Laplacian
  and the Hamiltonian eigenbases with the functional map formalism. We develop a global
  analysis to capture the asymptotic behavior of the eigenpairs. We then focus on
  their local interactions, namely the veering patterns that arise between proximal
  eigenvalues. Armed with this knowledge, we are able to track the eigenfunctions
  in all possible configurations, shedding light on the nature of the functional maps.
  We exploit the Hamiltonian-Dirichlet connection in a partial shape matching problem,
  obtaining state of the art results, and provide directions where our theoretical
  findings could be applied in future research.
