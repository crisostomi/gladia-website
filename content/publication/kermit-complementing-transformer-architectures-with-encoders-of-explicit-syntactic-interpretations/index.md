abstract: "Syntactic parsers have dominated natural language understanding for
  decades. Yet, their syntactic interpretations are losing centrality in
  downstream tasks due to the success of large-scale textual representation
  learners. In this paper, we propose KERMIT (Kernel-inspired Encoder with
  Recursive Mechanism for Interpretable Trees) to embed symbolic syntactic parse
  trees into artificial neural networks and to visualize how syntax is used in
  inference. We experimented with KERMIT paired with two state-of-the-art
  transformer-based universal sentence encoders (BERT and XLNet) and we showed
  that KERMIT can indeed boost their performance by effectively embedding
  human-coded universal syntactic representations in neural networks "
