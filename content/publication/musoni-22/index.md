abstract: The 3D cloth segmentation task is particularly challenging due to the extreme
  variation of shapes, even among the same category of clothes. Several data-driven
  methods try to cope with this problem but they have to face the lack of available
  data capable to generalize to the variety of real-world data. For this reason, we
  present GIM3D (Garments In Motion 3D), a synthetic dataset of clothed 3D human characters
  in different poses. The over 4000 3D models in this dataset are produced by a physical
  simulation of clothes with different fabrics, sizes, and tightness, using animated
  human avatars having a large variety of shapes. Our dataset is composed of single
  meshes created to simulate 3D scans, with labels for the separate clothes and the
  visible body parts. We also provide an evaluation of the use of GIM3D as a training
  set on garment segmentation tasks using state-of-the-art data-driven methods for
  both meshes and point clouds.
