abstract: Deep learning approaches have recently raised the bar in many fields, from
  Natural Language Processing to Computer Vision, by leveraging large amounts of data.
  However, they could fail when the retrieved information is not enough to fit the
  vast number of parameters, frequently resulting in overfitting and therefore in
  poor generalizability. Few-Shot Learning aims at designing models that can effectively
  operate in a scarce data regime, yielding learning strategies that only need few
  supervised examples to be trained. These procedures are of both practical and theoretical
  importance, as they are crucial for many real-life scenarios in which data is either
  costly or even impossible to retrieve. Moreover, they bridge the distance between
  current data-hungry models and human-like generalization capability. Computer vision
  offers various tasks that can be few-shot inherent, such as person re-identification.
  This survey, which to the best of our knowledge is the first tackling this problem,
  is focused on Few-Shot Object Detection, which has received far less attention compared
  to Few-Shot Classification due to the intrinsic challenge level. In this regard,
  this review presents an extensive description of the approaches that have been tested
  in the current literature, discussing their pros and cons, and classifying them
  according to a rigorous taxonomy.
