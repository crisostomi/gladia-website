abstract: At the crossroads of Program Synthesis and Meta-Learning, we introduce Explanatory
  Learning as the task of automatically discovering the symbolic explanation (PS)
  that enables few-shot sensible predictions on a novel environment given experience
  on other environments (M-L). Differently from PS, the program (explanation) interpreter
  in EL is not given and should be learned from a limited collection of associations
  explanation-observations. Unlike M-L, EL does not prescribe any adaptation at test
  time, seeking generalization in the broad meanings attributed to symbols by the
  learned interpreter. To exemplify the challenges of EL, we present the Odeen benchmark,
  which can also serve the PS and M-L paradigms. Finally, we introduce Critical Rationalist
  Networks, a deep learning approach to EL aligned with the Popperian view of knowledge
  acquisition. CRNs express several desired properties by construction; they are truly
  explainable, can adjust their processing at test-time for harder inferences, and
  can offer strong confidence guarantees on their predictions. Using Odeen as a testbed,
  we show how CRNs outperform empiricist end-to-end approaches of similar size and
  architecture (Transformers) in discovering explanations for unseen environments.
