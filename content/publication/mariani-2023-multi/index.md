abstract: 'In this work, we define a diffusion-based generative model capable of both music synthesis and source separation by learning the score of the joint probability density of sources sharing a context. Alongside the classic total inference tasks (i.e. generating a mixture, separating the sources), we also introduce and experiment on the partial inference task of source imputation, where we generate a subset of the sources given the others (e.g., play a piano track that goes well with the drums). Additionally, we introduce a novel inference method for the separation task. We train our model on Slakh2100, a standard dataset for musical source separation, provide qualitative results in the generation settings, and showcase competitive quantitative results in the separation setting. Our method is the first example of a single model that can handle both generation and separation tasks, thus representing a step toward general audio models.'
