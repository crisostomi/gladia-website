abstract: 'The intrinsic random nature of quantum physics offers novel tools for the
  generation of random numbers, a central challenge for a plethora of fields. Bell
  non-local correlations obtained by measurements on entangled states allow for the
  generation of bit strings whose randomness is guaranteed in a device-independent
  manner, i.e. without assumptions on the measurement and state-generation devices.
  Here, we generate this strong form of certified randomness on a new platform: the
  so-called instrumental scenario, which is central to the field of causal inference.
  First, we theoretically show that certified random bits, private against general
  quantum adversaries, can be extracted exploiting device-independent quantum instrumental-inequality
  violations. Then, we experimentally implement the corresponding randomness-generation
  protocol using entangled photons and active feed-forward of information. Moreover,
  we show that, for low levels of noise, our protocol offers an advantage over the
  simplest Bell-nonlocality protocol based on the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality.'
