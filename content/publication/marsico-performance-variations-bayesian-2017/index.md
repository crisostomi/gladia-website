abstract: The paper presents a study of the performance variations of the Bayesian
  model of peer-assessment implemented in OpenAnswer, in terms of the grades prediction
  accuracy. OpenAnswer (OA) models a peer assessment session as a Bayesian network.
  For each student, a sub-network contains variables describing relevant aspects of
  both the individual cognitive state and the state of the current assessment session.
  Sub-networks are interconnected to each other to obtain the final one. Evidence
  propagated through the global network is represented by all the grades given by
  students to their peers, together with a subset of the teacher's corrections. Among
  the possible affecting factors, the paper reports about the investigation of the
  dependence of grades prediction performance on the quality of the class, i.e., the
  average level of proficiency of its students, and on the number of peers assessed
  by each student. The results show that both factors affect the accuracy of the inferred
  marks produced by the Bayesian network, when compared with the available ground-truth
  produced by teachers.
