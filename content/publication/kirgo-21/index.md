abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose a new construction for the Mexican hat
  wavelets on shapes with applications to partial shape matching. Our approach takes
  its main inspiration from the well-established methodology of diffusion wavelets.
  This novel construction allows us to rapidly compute a multi-scale family of Mexican
  hat wavelet functions, by approximating the derivative of the heat kernel. We demonstrate
  that this leads to a family of functions that inherit many attractive properties
  of the heat kernel (e.g. local support, ability to recover isometries from a single
  point, efficient computation). Due to its natural ability to encode high-frequency
  details on a shape, the proposed method reconstructs and transfers -functions more
  accurately than the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction basis and other related bases.
  Finally, we apply our method to the challenging problems of partial and large-scale
  shape matching. An extensive comparison to the state-of-the-art shows that it is
  comparable in performance, while both simpler and much faster than competing approaches.
