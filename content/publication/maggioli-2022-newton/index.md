title: "Newton's Fractals on Surfaces via Bicomplex Algebra"
subtitle: ''
summary: 'An algorithm that exploits features of the bicomplex field to compute 4-dimensional Newton fractals for procedural texturing applications. The generated fractals are computed in a pixel shader only on the target surface to achieve real-time performance.'

abstract: "Real-time procedural texturing is becoming more and more important as the need of large variety of contents increases. We propose a new technique that exploits the properties of a 4-dimensional algebraic field for efficiently computing on GPU a procedural texture with fractal properties. The produced pattern are shown to be well suitable in many applications, especially when used as building blocks for complex materials."
