abstract: 'The paper investigates if and how the topology of the peer-assessment network
  can affect the performance of the Bayesian model adopted in OpenAnswer. Performance
  is evaluated in terms of the comparison of predicted grades with actual teacher’s
  grades. The global network is built by interconnecting smaller subnetworks, one
  for each student, where intra-subnetwork nodes represent student’s characteristics,
  and peer assessment assignments make up inter-subnetwork connections and determine
  evidence propagation. A possible subset of teacher graded answers is dynamically
  determined by suitable selection and stop rules. The research questions addressed
  are: (RQ1) “does the topology (diameter) of the network negatively influence the
  precision of predicted grades?”; in the affirmative case, (RQ2) “are we able to
  reduce the negative effects of high-diameter networks through an appropriate choice
  of the subset of students to be corrected by the teacher?” We show that (RQ1) OpenAnswer
  is less effective on higher diameter topologies, (RQ2) this can be avoided if the
  subset of corrected students is chosen considering the network topology.'
