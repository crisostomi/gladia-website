abstract: 'We consider the problem of deformable object detection and dense correspondence
  in cluttered 3D scenes. Key ingredient to our method is the choice of representation:
  we formulate the problem in the spectral domain using the functional maps framework,
  where we seek for the most regular nearly-isometric parts in the model and the scene
  that minimize correspondence error. The problem is initialized by solving a sparse
  relaxation of a quadratic assignment problem on features obtained via data-driven
  metric learning. The resulting matching pipeline is solved efficiently, and yields
  accurate results in challenging settings that were previously left unexplored in
  the literature. © 2016 IEEE.'
