    abstract = "In this paper, we present SyntNN as a way to include traditional syntactic models in multilayer neural networks used in the task of Semeval Task 2 of emoji prediction. The model builds on the distributed tree embedder also known as distributed tree kernel. Initial results are extremely encouraging but additional analysis is needed to overcome the problem of overfitting.",
