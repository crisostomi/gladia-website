abstract: In this paper, we present SyntNN as a way to include traditional
  syntactic models in multilayer neural networks used in the task of Semeval
  Task 2 of emoji prediction. The model builds on the distributed tree embedder
  also known as distributed tree kernel. Initial results are extremely
  encouraging but additional analysis is needed to overcome the problem of
  overfitting.
