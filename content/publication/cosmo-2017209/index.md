abstract: Recent efforts in the area of joint object matching approach the problem
  by taking as input a set of pairwise maps, which are then jointly optimized across
  the whole collection so that certain accuracy and consistency criteria are satisfied.
  One natural requirement is cycle-consistency—namely the fact that map composition
  should give the same result regardless of the path taken in the shape collection.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to obtain consistent matches without
  requiring initial pairwise solutions to be given as input. We do so by optimizing
  a joint measure of metric distortion directly over the space of cycle-consistent
  maps; in order to allow for partially similar and extra-class shapes, we formulate
  the problem as a series of quadratic programs with sparsity-inducing constraints,
  making our technique a natural candidate for analysing collections with a large
  presence of outliers. The particular form of the problem allows us to leverage results
  and tools from the field of evolutionary game theory. This enables a highly efficient
  optimization procedure which assures accurate and provably consistent solutions
  in a matter of minutes in collections with hundreds of shapes.
