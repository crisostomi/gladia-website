abstract: 'Matching deformable 3D shapes under partiality transformations is a challenging
  problem that has received limited focus in the computer vision and graphics communities.
  With this benchmark, we explore and thoroughly investigate the robustness of existing
  matching methods in this challenging task. Participants are asked to provide a point-to-point
  correspondence (either sparse or dense) between deformable shapes undergoing different
  kinds of partiality transformations, resulting in a total of 400 matching problems
  to be solved for each method - making this benchmark the biggest and most challenging
  of its kind. Five matching algorithms were evaluated in the contest; this paper
  presents the details of the dataset, the adopted evaluation measures, and shows
  thorough comparisons among all competing methods.'
