abstract: "We introduce OLIVAW, an AI Othello player adopting the design principles\
  \ of the famous AlphaGo programs. The main motivation behind OLIVAW was to attain\
  \ exceptional competence in a non-trivial board game at a tiny fraction of the cost\
  \ of its illustrious predecessors. In this paper, we show how the AlphaGo Zero's\
  \ paradigm can be successfully applied to the popular game of Othello using only\
  \ commodity hardware and free cloud services. While being simpler than Chess or\
  \ Go, Othello maintains a considerable search space and difficulty in evaluating\
  \ board positions. To achieve this result, OLIVAW implements some improvements inspired\
  \ by recent works to accelerate the standard AlphaGo Zero learning process. The\
  \ main modification implies doubling the positions collected per game during the\
  \ training phase, by including also positions not played but largely explored by\
  \ the agent. We tested the strength of OLIVAW in three different ways: by pitting\
  \ it against Edax, the strongest open-source Othello engine, by playing anonymous\
  \ games on the web platform OthelloQuest, and finally in two in-person matches against\
  \ top-notch human players: a national champion and a former world champion."
