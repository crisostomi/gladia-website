abstract: State of the art audio source separation models rely on supervised data-driven
  approaches, which can be expensive in terms of labeling resources. On the other
  hand, approaches for training these models without any direct supervision are typically
  high-demanding in terms of memory and time requirements, and remain impractical
  to be used at inference time. We aim to tackle these limitations by proposing a
  simple yet effective unsupervised separation algorithm, which operates directly
  on a latent representation of time-domain signals. Our algorithm relies on deep
  Bayesian priors in the form of pre-trained autoregressive networks to model the
  probability distributions of each source. We leverage the low cardinality of the
  discrete latent space, trained with a novel loss term imposing a precise arithmetic
  structure on it, to perform exact Bayesian inference without relying on an approximation
  strategy. We validate our approach on the Slakh dataset arXiv:1909.08494, demonstrating
  results in line with state of the art supervised approaches while requiring fewer
  resources with respect to other unsupervised methods.
