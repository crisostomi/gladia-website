abstract: Abstract In this paper, we introduce complex functional maps, which extend
  the functional map framework to conformal maps between tangent vector fields on
  surfaces. A key property of these maps is their orientation awareness. More specifically,
  we demonstrate that unlike regular functional maps that link functional spaces of
  two manifolds, our complex functional maps establish a link between oriented tangent
  bundles, thus permitting robust and efficient transfer of tangent vector fields.
  By first endowing and then exploiting the tangent bundle of each shape with a complex
  structure, the resulting operations become naturally orientation-aware, thus favouring
  orientation and angle preserving correspondence across shapes, without relying on
  descriptors or extra regularization. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, we demonstrate
  how these objects enable several practical applications within the functional map
  framework. We show that functional maps and their complex counterparts can be estimated
  jointly to promote orientation preservation, regularizing pipelines that previously
  suffered from orientation-reversing symmetry errors.
